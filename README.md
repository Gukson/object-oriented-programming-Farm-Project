# Farm and Agricultural Machines Simulation

This project was created during the second year of studies in Computer Engineering at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. The project involves simulating a farm and the agricultural machines operating on it. The key aspect of this project is that the entire environment and the machines function in a networked environment, accessible through a shared interface. The project heavily relies on RMI (Remote Method Invocation) for communication and operation.

## Running the Project

To run the project:

1. Start by launching the `main` class and wait until you see the message "waiting" displayed in the console.
2. Then, run `MachineGUI` and specify the port number.

**Important:** Ensure the port number is different from 5001, as this port is reserved for the world simulation.
